You can build samples using the cmake build system (available at http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).
To build a sample, just run fxbuild.sh from the sample directory.


To use ForexConnect API in your C++ application, you should:

1) Place supporting shared libraries in the same directory where your application program is located.
Or you can place supporting shared libraries in the /usr/lib directory.

2) Add libForexConnect to the list of libraries in the linker options. For example, if you use gcc, the option will be -lForexConnect. 
The path to the directory containing the libraries (e.g. /ForexConnectAPI/lib) can be specified by the -L/ForexConnectAPI/lib option. 

3) Include the header file in your code using the directive #include <ForexConnect.h>.
The path to the directory containing the headers (e.g. /ForexConnectAPI/include) can be specified by the -I/ForexConnectAPI/include option.
